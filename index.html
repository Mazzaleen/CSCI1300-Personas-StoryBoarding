        <ul>
            <li>Most students try to reach their hand inside to check for any divorced socks</li>
            <li>Some students would set a timer once they load their clothes, many didnt!</li>
            <li>students varied alot in detergent type (tid pods/fluid) and products (color catchers etc). </li>
            <li>Most students are not aware of changing the mesh filter between cycles</li>
            <li>I found it interesting that alot of students forgot to fill up their bear bucks account until washing. </li>

        <h3><b> Summarized Responses</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Students generally had one laundry day per week, ranging from 1-3 cycles used. </li>
            <li>Students often had to wait for avaliability, ranging from 5-30 minutes. They seldom went to other dorms</li>
            <li>Dryers specifically were underpopulated and poor quality, hence dryer sheets being common among students </li>
            <li>No one seperated colors and whites, 'perm press' option used most frequently, irrespective of items.  </li>
            <li>Despite alarms/timers, alot of machines were broken and most students werent sure who to call, opting to text the dorm chat instead.</li>
