<!-- Part 2 -->
    <div class="Part-2-Section">
        <h2><b>Part II: Recording Observations</b></h2>

        <h3>Key Observations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Most students try to reach their hand inside to check for any divorced socks</li>
            <li>Some students would set a timer once they load their clothes, many didnt!</li>
            <li>students varied alot in detergent type (tid pods/fluid) and products (color catchers etc). </li>
            <li>Most students are not aware of changing the mesh filter between cycles</li>
            <li>I found it interesting that alot of students forgot to fill up their bear bucks account until washing. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>User Research Questions</b></h2>
            <ol>
                <li>How many times a week do you do laundry? </li>
                <li>How many cycles does it take during your laundry day? Has there ever been times where you needed to rerun?</li>
                <li>How many times have you had to wait for a machine to become available? How long is the wait usually?</li>
                <li>What's your approach when all machines are occupied? </li>
                <li>On a scale of A to NC: How happy are with the student: machine ratio in your dorm?</li>
                <li>How do you feel about the state of your clothes after washing & drying? </li>
                <li>Do you seperate colors and whites?  </li>
                <li>Do you use any supplemental products? (fabric softener, color catchers,dyer sheets) </li>
                <li>Whats your approach after loading a machine? What happens if you forget? </li>
                <li>What's your most frequent setting when washing & drying? Does the type of clothes impact your decision?</li>
                <li>How often are mechines busted? What do you usually do in those scenarios?</li>
                <li> Do you check your dorm chat often for any laundry alerts by other students? If so, How useful is it?</li>
                <li>is there anything you would like to add based off of your experience?</li>
            </ol>
        <h3><b> Summarized Responses</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Students generally had one laundry day per week, ranging from 1-3 cycles used. </li>
            <li>Students often had to wait for avaliability, ranging from 5-30 minutes. They seldom went to other dorms</li>
            <li>Dryers specifically were underpopulated and poor quality, hence dryer sheets being common among students </li>
            <li>No one seperated colors and whites, 'perm press' option used most frequently, irrespective of items.  </li>
            <li>Despite alarms/timers, alot of machines were broken and most students werent sure who to call, opting to text the dorm chat instead.</li>
